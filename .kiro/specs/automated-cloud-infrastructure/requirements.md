# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project aims to build a comprehensive automated end-to-end cloud infrastructure deployment system that demonstrates core DevOps practices. The system will deploy a highly available, secure, and scalable AWS infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) with automated CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions). The project serves as a portfolio piece showcasing modern DevOps engineering skills including cloud architecture, automation, monitoring, and security best practices.

## Requirements

6. WHEN documenting the architecture THEN the system SHALL provide visual diagrams showing component relationships and data flow

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to implement comprehensive security measures, so that the infrastructure follows AWS security best practices and demonstrates security expertise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring access control THEN the system SHALL implement IAM roles and policies following the principle of least privilege

6. WHEN setting up S3 buckets THEN the system SHALL implement proper bucket policies and encryption

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to write Infrastructure as Code using Terraform, so that I can demonstrate IaC best practices and create reproducible infrastructure deployments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing Terraform code THEN the system SHALL organize resources into logical modules (networking, compute, database, storage)
2. WHEN parameterizing infrastructure THEN the system SHALL use variables and locals for environment-specific configurations
3. WHEN managing state THEN the system SHALL use remote state storage with state locking
4. WHEN structuring code THEN the system SHALL follow Terraform best practices for file organization and naming conventions
5. WHEN creating reusable components THEN the system SHALL implement Terraform modules for common infrastructure patterns
6. WHEN documenting infrastructure THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive variable descriptions and output values

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to implement automated CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions, so that I can demonstrate continuous integration and deployment practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to feature branches THEN the system SHALL automatically run Terraform linting and validation
2. WHEN creating pull requests THEN the system SHALL automatically run terraform plan and post results as PR comments
3. WHEN merging to main branch THEN the system SHALL automatically run terraform apply with proper approval gates
4. WHEN authenticating with AWS THEN the system SHALL use AWS Access Keys stored securely in GitHub Secrets
5. WHEN protecting the main branch THEN the system SHALL enforce branch protection rules requiring PR reviews
6. WHEN running workflows THEN the system SHALL implement proper error handling and notification mechanisms

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting, so that I can demonstrate observability practices and proactive system management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring infrastructure THEN the system SHALL enable CloudWatch monitoring for all EC2 instances and RDS databases
2. WHEN collecting logs THEN the system SHALL configure centralized logging for application and system logs
3. WHEN setting up alerts THEN the system SHALL create CloudWatch alarms for critical metrics (CPU, memory, disk, database connections)
4. WHEN threshold breaches occur THEN the system SHALL send notifications via SNS to email or Slack
5. WHEN monitoring costs THEN the system SHALL implement cost monitoring and budget alerts
6. WHEN creating dashboards THEN the system SHALL provide CloudWatch dashboards for system visibility

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to create comprehensive documentation, so that the project demonstrates professional documentation practices and can be easily understood by potential employers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documenting the project THEN the system SHALL include a detailed README with setup instructions and prerequisites
2. WHEN explaining architecture THEN the system SHALL provide clear architecture diagrams with component descriptions
3. WHEN documenting deployment THEN the system SHALL include step-by-step deployment and teardown instructions
4. WHEN showing results THEN the system SHALL include screenshots of deployed infrastructure and monitoring dashboards
5. WHEN suggesting improvements THEN the system SHALL document potential enhancements and scaling considerations
6. WHEN explaining decisions THEN the system SHALL document architectural and technology choices with rationale

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to implement cost optimization and visibility features, so that I can demonstrate financial responsibility and cost management skills.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN planning infrastructure changes THEN the system SHALL document cost implications and optimization opportunities
2. WHEN deploying resources THEN the system SHALL use appropriate instance types and storage classes for cost optimization
3. WHEN monitoring costs THEN the system SHALL implement cost-aware resource tagging and documentation
4. WHEN reviewing changes THEN the system SHALL include cost considerations in change documentation
5. WHEN managing resources THEN the system SHALL implement auto-scaling policies to optimize costs based on demand
6. WHEN documenting costs THEN the system SHALL provide cost breakdown and optimization recommendations

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to ensure high availability and disaster recovery, so that I can demonstrate enterprise-grade infrastructure design skills.

#### Acceptance Criteria
