# TFLint Status - FIXED

## Previous Issue (RESOLVED):
Error: Unsupported attribute - module.storage does not have an attribute named "access_logs_bucket_name"

## Resolution:
- Added missing `access_logs_bucket_name` output to terraform/modules/storage/outputs.tf
- Added `access_logs_bucket_id` and `access_logs_bucket_arn` outputs for completeness
- Updated `bucket_names` and `bucket_arns` maps to include access_logs bucket
- Fixed the ALB logs bucket configuration in compute module

## Status: ✅ READY FOR VALIDATION

The TFLint validation error has been resolved. The Terraform validation should now pass all checks.

## What was fixed:
1. ✅ Missing storage module output for access logs bucket
2. ✅ ALB logs bucket parameter now properly references existing bucket
3. ✅ All bucket outputs are now consistent and complete
4. ✅ Terraform validation should pass without errors
