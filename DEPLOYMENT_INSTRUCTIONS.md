# üöÄ Infrastructure Deployment Instructions

## Current Status: Ready to Deploy!

Your infrastructure code is complete and validated. We just need to configure AWS credentials and deploy.

## Step 1: Configure AWS Credentials

You need to configure AWS credentials before we can deploy. You have several options:

### Option A: AWS Configure (Recommended)
```bash
aws configure
```
You'll be prompted for:
- AWS Access Key ID
- AWS Secret Access Key  
- Default region (use: `us-west-2`)
- Default output format (use: `json`)

### Option B: Environment Variables
```powershell
$env:AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-access-key-here"
$env:AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret-key-here"
$env:AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="us-west-2"
```

### Option C: AWS SSO (if your organization uses it)
```bash
aws sso login
```

## Step 2: Get AWS Credentials

If you don't have AWS credentials yet:

1. **AWS Academy/Learner Lab**: 
   - Go to your AWS Academy course
   - Start the Learner Lab
   - Click "AWS Details" 
   - Copy the AWS CLI credentials

2. **Personal AWS Account**:
   - Go to AWS Console ‚Üí IAM ‚Üí Users
   - Create a new user with programmatic access
   - Attach policies: `AdministratorAccess` (for lab purposes)
   - Save the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key

3. **AWS Free Tier Account**:
   - Sign up at https://aws.amazon.com/free/
   - Create IAM user with admin permissions

## Step 3: Verify Credentials

After configuring, test with:
```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

You should see your account information.

## Step 4: Deploy Infrastructure

Once credentials are configured, I'll help you deploy:

1. **Backend Setup** (S3 + DynamoDB for Terraform state)
2. **Development Environment** (Cost-optimized for testing)
3. **Production Environment** (Full-featured setup)

## Expected Costs

- **Development**: ~$20-50/month
- **Production**: ~$100-200/month
- **Backend**: ~$5/month

Most resources are in AWS Free Tier eligible.

## Next Steps

1. Configure your AWS credentials using one of the methods above
2. Let me know when ready, and I'll start the deployment process
3. We'll deploy backend first, then dev environment, then prod
